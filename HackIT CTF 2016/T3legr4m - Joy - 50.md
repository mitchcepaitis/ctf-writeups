### Solution

This was not exactly a challenge, but I am so happy that they included it.  This 'challenge' got people to join the Telegram chat, which made the competition more social.  People were encouraging each others, taunting each other, and creating this great sense of community.  If this wasn't a 'challenge' I'm not sure I would have decided to join.  This was my first CTF ever, and this social aspect really elevated the experience.

The flag was located in the channel info panel.

> Get just basic information from this server (ctf.ekoparty.org).


### Solution

When faced with such a blatant clue, it's usually worthwhile to pursue it.  The name of the challenge, RFC 7230, is the document that describes the HTTP 1.1 protocol.

I made a simple GET request to the server using `nc`:

```bash
$ nc -vv ctf.ekoparty.org 80
ctf.site [52.204.197.190] 80 (http) open
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: ctf.ekoparty.org

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: EKO{this_is_my_great_server}
Date: Thu, 27 Oct 2016 04:11:13 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 178
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://ctf.ekoparty.org/
```

Easy enough, the flag was in the "Server:" line.

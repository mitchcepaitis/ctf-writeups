### Solution
The given web page seemed to be asking the user to perform 100 mathematical operations.  This is a web challenge, so the solution was __not__ to do all the math operations.  This challenge could be completed by simply editing the browser cookie to claim that the user had really completed all operations.  The flag is then revealed on the web page.
